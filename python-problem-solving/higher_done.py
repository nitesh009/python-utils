We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!

'''

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num):

    def guessNumber(self, n):

        low, high = 0, n+1
        mid = (low + high)/2
        val = guess(mid)
        while(val != 0):
            if(val == 1):
                low = mid
            if(val == -1):

            mid = (low + high)/2
